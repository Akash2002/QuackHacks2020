### Problem
-----------------
In 2018 alone, more than 35 million people in the US were food insecure, with over 4.6 million extremely insecure. Even though food banks try to supply food to as many people as possible, satisfying the needs of the massive food-insecure population is far from accomplished. Whatâ€™s more? The younger generation feels a social stigma attached to food banks, of having to drive by foodbanks to get food. Heck, even the older population! Furthermore, during such a tough time as the COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to develop a solution that would ease the food insecurity of millions of households in America and across the world. By providing a sustainable delivery system that relies on the free will of the people, food banks can expend the money they spend on delivery on securing food resources during a time of relative food scarcity and insecurity, all while reaching more people then ever before.

### Solution
----------------
We want to revolutionize how food banks work. We want to open up a new world of volunteer-based doordash for the lower sectors of society instead of having trucks deliver packages of food throughout the country--that is exactly what we have done. We present to you NutriChain. A mobile app for practically everyone, both food banks and individuals. A food bank simply registers with its meal plan, and once a particular family/individual places an order, volunteers come together to deliver the food at their convenience while spending minimal time through our unique delivery system through a chain of volunteers. Delivering for others earns you tokens for your own free meals--a truly give and take system.  
##### Process
First the user who wants food orders it from the food bank. The food bank processes the order, waiting for any pickup requests. Person A issues a pick-up request from their home, picks up the food, and brings it to their home. Person B issues a pick-up request to pick-up the food from Person A's home. Finally the user picks up the delivery from Person B's home at gets their food. This chaining method allows for delivery over long distances with negligble investment of resources or time from any one party: a community effort that minimizes operating costs and maximizes outreach.

### Technicalities
-------------------
We have used Firebase Firestore to manage data from the cloud and Firebase Authentication to manage the two user types (food banks and individuals). We have built the entire app with React Native and JavaScript to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
